Description
-----------
Reads spreadsheets from specified Google Drive directory via Google Sheets API.

Properties
----------
### Basic

**Directory Identifier:** Identifier of the source folder.

This comes after `folders/` in the URL. For example, if the URL is
```
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dyUEebJaFnWa3Z4n0BFMVAXQ7mfUH11g?resourcekey=0-XVijrJSp3E3gkdJp20MpCQ
```
Then the Directory Identifier would be `1dyUEebJaFnWa3Z4n0BFMVAXQ7mfUH11g`.

### Filtering

**Filter:** Filter that can be applied to the files in the selected directory. 
Filters follow the [Google Drive filters syntax](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/ref-search-terms).

**Modification Date Range:** Filter that narrows set of files by modified date range. 
User can select either among predefined or custom entered ranges. 
For _Custom_ selection the dates range can be specified via **Start date** and **End date**. 

**Start Date:** Start date for custom modification date range. 
Is shown only when _Custom_ range is selected for **Modification date range** field. 
[RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format, default timezone is UTC, e.g., 2012-06-04T12:00:00-08:00.

**End Date:** End date for custom modification date range. 
Is shown only when _Custom_ range is selected for **Modification date range** field.
[RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format, default timezone is UTC, e.g., 2012-06-04T12:00:00-08:00.

**Sheets To Pull:** Filter that specifies set of sheets to process. 
For 'numbers' or 'titles' selections user can populate specific values in 'Sheets identifiers' field.

**Sheets Identifiers:** Set of sheets' numbers/titles to process. 
Is shown only when 'titles' or 'numbers' are selected for 'Sheets to pull' field.

### Authentication

**Authentication Type:** Type of authentication used to access Google API.

OAuth2 and Service Account types are available.

Make sure that:
* `Google Drive API` and `Google Sheets API` is enabled in the `GCP Project`.
* `Google Drive Folder` is shared to the service account email used with the required permission.

#### OAuth2 Properties

OAuth2 client credentials can be generated on Google Cloud 
[Credentials Page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)

**Client ID:** OAuth2 client id used to identify the application.

**Client Secret:** OAuth2 client secret used to access the authorization server.

**Refresh Token:** OAuth2 refresh token to acquire new access tokens.

For more details on OAuth2, see [Google Drive Api Documentation](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/about-auth)

#### Service Account Type

Make sure that the Google Drive Folder is shared with the specified service account email. 
`Viewer` role must be granted to the specified service account to read files from the Google Drive Folder.

* **Service Account File Path**: Path on the local file system of the service account key used for
  authorization. 

  Can be set to 'auto-detect' when running on a Dataproc cluster which needs to be
  created with the following scopes:
  * https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
  * https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly
  
  When running on other clusters, the file must be present on every node in the cluster.

* **Service Account JSON**: Contents of the service account JSON file. Service Account JSON can be generated on Google Cloud
  [Service Account page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)

### Metadata Extraction

**Extract Metadata:** Field to enable metadata extraction. Metadata extraction is useful when user wants to specify 
a header or a footer for a sheet. The rows in headers and footers are not available as data records. 
Instead, they are available in every record as a field called 'metadata', which is a record of the specified metadata.

**Metadata Field Name:** Name of the record with metadata content. 
It is needed to distinguish metadata record from possible column with the same name.

**First Row of Header:** Row number of the first row to be treated as header.

**Last Row of Header:** Row number of the last row to be treated as header.

**First Row of Footer:** Row number of the first row to be treated as footer.

**Last Row of Footer:** Row number of the last row to be treated as footer.

**Metadata Cells:** Set of the cells for key-value pairs to extract as metadata from the specified metadata sections.
Only shown if **Extract metadata** is set to true. The cell numbers should be within the header or footer.

### Advanced

**Text Formatting:** Output format for numeric sheet cells. 
In 'Formatted values' case the value will contain appropriate format of source cell e.g. '1.23$', '123%'." 
For 'Values only' only number value will be returned.

**Skip Empty Data:** Field that allows skipping of empty structure records.

**Add spreadsheet/sheet name fields:** Toggle that defines if the source extends output schema with 
spreadsheet and sheet names.

**Spreadsheet field name:** Schema field name for spreadsheet name.

**Sheet field name:** Schema field name for sheet name.

**Column Names Selection:** Source for column names. User can specify where from the plugin should get schema filed names.
Are available following values: _No column names_ - default sheet column names will be used ('A', 'B' etc.), 
_Treat first row as column names_ - the plugin uses first row for schema defining and field names,
 _Custom row as column names_ - as previous, but for custom row index.

**Column Names Row Number:** Number of the row to be treated as a header.
Only shown when the 'Column Names Selection' field is set to 'Custom row as column names' header.

**Number of Columns to Read:** Last column plugin will read as data. It will be ignored if the Column 
Names Row contains less number of columns.

**Number of Rows to Read:** Last row plugin will read as data.

**Read Buffer Size:** Number of rows the source reads with a single API request. Default value is 100.

### Steps to Generate OAuth2 Credentials
1. Create credentials for the Client ID and Client Secret properties [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
2. On the Create OAuth client ID page, under Authorized redirect URIs, specify a URI of `http://localhost:8080`.
   This is just to generate the `refresh token`.
3. Click `Create`. The OAuth client is created. For more information, see this [doc](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/authentication#webapp).
4. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to the plugin properties.
5. To get the Refresh Token, follow these steps:
   1. Authenticate and authorize with the Google Auth server to get an authorization `code`.
   2. Use that authorization code with the Google Token server to get a `refresh token` that the plugin will use to get future access tokens.

   To get the authorization code, you can copy the URL below, change to use your `client_id`, and
   then open that URL in a browser window.
   ```
   https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?
   scope=https%3A//www.googleapis.com/auth/drive%20https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly&
   access_type=offline&
   include_granted_scopes=true&
   response_type=code&                  
   state=state_parameter_passthrough_value&
   redirect_uri=http%3A//localhost:8080&
   client_id=199375159079-st8toco9pfu1qi5b45fkj59unc5th2v1.apps.googleusercontent.com
   ```
   This will prompt you to login, authorize this client for specified scopes,
   and then redirect you to `http://localhost:8080`. It will look like an error page,
   but notice that the URL of the error page redirected to include the `code`.
   In a normal web application, that is how the authorization code is returned to the requesting web application.
   
   For example, URL of the page will be something like
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/?state=state_parameter_passthrough_value&code=4/0AX4XfWi6PsiJiPO4MjltrcD6uoRgwci-HX16aL1-Ax-tgqYgC47NnjtCCKRoVzv46m8aJw&scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
   ```
   Here, code=`4/0AX4XfWi6PsiJiPO4MjltrcD6uoRgwci-HX16aL1-Ax-tgqYgC47NnjtCCKRoVzv46m8aJw`.

   **NOTE**: If you see an error like this `Authorization Error — Error 400: admin_policy_enforced`,
   then the GCP User’s organization has a policy that restricts you from using Client IDs for third party products.
   In that case, they’ll need to get that restriction lifted, or use a different GCP user in a different org.
   
   With that authorization code, you can now call the Google Token server to get the `access token` and
   the `refresh token` in the response. Set the `code`, `client_id`, and `client_secret` in the curl command below and
   run it in a Cloud Shell terminal.
   ```
   curl -X POST -d "code=4/0AX4XfWjgRdrWXuNxqXOOtw_9THZlwomweFrzcoHMBbTFkrKLMvo8twSXdGT9JramIYq86w&client_id=199375159079-st8toco9pfu1qi5b45fkj59unc5th2v1.apps.googleusercontent.com&client_secret=q2zQ-vc3wG5iF5twSwBQkn68&redirect_uri=http%3A//localhost:8080&grant_type=authorization_code&access_type=offline" \
   https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
   ```
6. Now, you will have your `refresh_token`, which is the last OAuth 2.0 property that the Google Sheets Batch Source needs
   to authorize with the Google Drive and Google Sheets API.
